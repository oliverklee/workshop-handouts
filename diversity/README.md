# Creating diversity and awareness in the TYPO3 community

## Sociological and psychological concepts

### Diversity
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_(politics))

A community or group is considered _diverse_ if its members are different,
particularly concerning the following aspects:

* gender identity ((cis-)male, (cis-)female, genderqueer/nonbinary, transgender …)
* sexual orientation (heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, asexual …)
* enthnicity (black, hispanic, asian, caucasian …)
* age (young, old …)
* religion (Islamic, Christian, atheist, Hindu …)
* physical abilities (blind, deaf, mute, wheelchair-bound, red-green-blind,
  able-bodied …)
* physical health
* attractiveness
* mental health (autistic, having axieties, having depression, …)
* intelligence
* socioeconomic background (having grown up with lots of or little money,
  having had books around as a child, having a/no university degree, …)

There are studies that show that diverse team are more productive and create
products that appeal to (and work for) larger target groups.

### Inclusion
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclusion_(disability_rights))

_Inclusion_ means removing barriers and providing help for people with
disabilities (in the narrower sense), removing barriers for people that
are underrepresented in a group/event, and even making the
group/community/event openly welcoming to underrepresented groups so
they can integrate easily.
 
Being inclusive is necessary for improving diversity (although not sufficient
in itself).


### *phobia

*Phobias (islamophobia, homophobia, …) mean that a person is hateful of a
certain group or has prejudices towards this group.

There are also phobias in the _psychological_ sense (agoraphobia, arachnophobia,
…). Those are not relevant in this context.

### *isms

*isms (sexism, racism, …) refer to actions of structures that work against
members of certain identity groups. (There is no really clear border between
*phobias and *isms, though.)

#### Hostile and benevolent sexism
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambivalent_sexism)

_Sexism_ (the notion that persons of one gender are less worth than other
genders) comes in two flavors:

_Hostile sexism_ refers to the notion that persons of one particular gender
are incompetent, stupid etc., while _benevolent_ sexism refers to the notion
that members of a certain gender need to be protected etc. because they are
weaker, nobler etc.

#### Ableism/abelism
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism)

Ableism refers to the notion that able-bodied persons are "normal" and that the
needs of disabled people are not important.

### Microaggressions
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression)

Microaggressions ("death by a thousand cuts") describes a situation where a
person experiences a huge amount of relatively small hostile/aggressive acts,
which in the sum still can make a situation intolerable and drive the person
away from the group/situtation.

The persons committing the microaggressions usually see their behavior as
"no big deal".

### Cognitive biases
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)
[Online self-test for biases](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html)

A _cognitive bias_ refers to tendencies to see a situation in a non-subjective
or non-rational way without being aware of this.

#### Confirmation bias
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)

_Confirmation bias_ refers to the tendency to recognize facts that confirm
one's opinion while ignoring facts that contradict one's opinion in order to
avoid cognitive dissonance.

### Privilege
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_(social_inequality))
[articla about privilege](https://medium.com/@ninavizz/systemic-sexism-101-2297043ac6c1)

Privilege refers to "playing the game of life at an easier difficulty setting"
due to being born (or having grown up) with certain properties, for example:

* able-bodied
* white
* cis-male
* heterosexual
* intelligent
* having wealthy parents and a good education

Being privileged in certain aspects does not mean "having a good life", but it
can lead to a tendency to generalize this "easier setting" concerning other
people and dismissing their experiences.

The statement "check your privilege" is used to remind someone that they might
be privileged, and that other people might have had vastly different
experiences.
